Packet received format:
[packet_length, angle_lb, angle_hb, count, angle_change_lb, angle_change_hb, status,crc_lb, crc_hb]

the packet_length has been added by me through arduino to help in crc calculations

Get the CRC Validity check working:
	Tried different CRC libraries but generated CRC and received CRC is different

Get the relation between handwheel and steering:
	Function is defined in steer_encoder.cpp

Compile generated object .o files to shared objects:
	Try dynamically loading the libraries instead of multi-file compilation
